- 👋 Hi, I’m @darkElvEnjoyer
-------------------------- Current Status ☝️🤓 ------------------------

I'm working at Daemonica. Singleplayer adventure experience where you play as Gwendolyn Dynaskaaldia an Londorian detective in a case of recent Daemonica occult rising.
Tho the occult purpose is stricte Daemonic connected the true purpose of existing this dangerous organisation is far beyond truth.
To uncover it an extraordinary depiction of a detective is required.
Explore, think and move on no matter the outcomes, true anti-hero as the Gwendolyn is will find a solution even if the tides are turned.
